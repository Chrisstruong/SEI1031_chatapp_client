# SEI1031_Union
## Project Summary
A live chat app for SEI1031 graduates to keep in touch after Feb 6th so that they can share some tips if they are hired.
## Description
I love SEI1031 community so much, so I decide to make an app that hopefully somebody will love so that I can keep in touch with them. The main point of this chat is that people can share their stories how they got hired. This will be our similarity when the final destination is to learn and get a job.

## Feature List
### MVP:
+ A live chat app.
+ Authentication
+ Upload user's own avatar (cartoon)
+ Have icons
### Stretch goals:
+ Call or video call function
+ Adding icon reaction.
+ Upload image, video, giphy, etc
## User stories
My target will be only SEI1031_gradutates. If I make them love it, I think I will make an app for a bigger community. I just want to focus specifically on small group first before I make an impact on bigger one. It just will be a live chat for us to keep in touch.
## Milestones:
I will set up my repos on day 1 and work on backend tomorrow. The deadline for backend will be day 2. After that, I will try to make the front-end to be able to display a live chat to a single person, add icons, authentication, upload user's avatar by the end of day 4. Day 5 will work on styling. I will work on one feature of stretch goals at the weekend. This is the perfect picture. I am not sure yet hihi.
## Feasibility studies
+ 3rd party api extensions: MongoDB
+ I think I need to fetch 3rd party API for my icons.
